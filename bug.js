This bug occurs when using the Expo SDK's `Camera` component with custom styles.  The issue manifests as the camera preview failing to render correctly, often appearing blank or displaying only a portion of the expected view. This is particularly problematic when integrating the camera within a complex layout or using advanced styling techniques such as `flex` or `position:absolute`.  The problem is exacerbated by using specific versions of Expo and React Native, and it's inconsistently reproducible across different devices and simulators.
