# Expo Camera Preview Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera component with custom styles. The camera preview may not render correctly, appearing blank or showing only a partial view. This issue is inconsistent and seems to be related to specific versions of Expo, React Native, and potentially device/simulator factors.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app using `expo start`.
4. Observe the camera preview.  You may need to experiment with different devices or simulators to reproduce the issue consistently.

## Potential Solutions

The provided `bugSolution.js` file presents a possible workaround, but a complete solution requires further investigation into the root cause of this problem within the Expo Camera component.
