The solution involves carefully reviewing the styling applied to the `Camera` component and its parent elements.  Avoid overly complex or conflicting styles.  Ensure that the camera view has sufficient space to render correctly.  Simplify the layout, and try temporarily removing potentially problematic styles to identify the root cause. This approach may also require experimenting with different versions of Expo and React Native to find a stable configuration. A potential solution might be to use a specific style to force the camera to render properly. This is just a temporary workaround; A permanent solution requires investigation by the Expo team. In the `bugSolution.js` file, a possible workaround is presented; It involves ensuring the camera container has explicit dimensions and is properly positioned within the layout.  This can sometimes resolve rendering issues by providing the camera with a clear area to render into.
